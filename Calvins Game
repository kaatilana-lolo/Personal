Calvin wakes up early one morning and finds that all his friends in the hostel are asleep. To amuse himself, he decides to play the following game : he draws a sequence of N squares on the ground, numbered 1 to N, and writes an integer in each square. He starts at square k (1 ≤ k ≤ N). The game consists of one forward phase followed by one backward phase.

In the forward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p+1 or p+2 as long as he stays within the N squares.

In the backward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p−1 or p−2 as long as he stays within the N squares.

He plays such that he finally ends up at square 1, and then he stops. He starts with a score of 0, and each time he jumps from square i to square j, he adds the integer written in square j to his score. Find the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing this game. Recall that Calvin must start at square k and end at square 1. The integer on the square where he starts is not included in his score.

For example, suppose N = 5 and the numbers in squares are 5, 3, −2, 1, 1. If k = 2, Calvin starts on the second square. He can make a forward move to square 4, another to square 5, a backward move to square 4, another to square 2, and another to square 1. His total score is 1+1+1+3+5 = 11. You can check that this is the maximum score possible.
