Indian National Olympiad in Informatics 2012
The Republic of Tutaria is celebrating its 37th year of independence. To mark the occasion, the nation is organising a contest where all its N citizens take part. The event has three tracks, a COBOL programming competition, pole vault, and a doughnut-eating competition. Each citizen takes part in these three tracks in the same orderâ€”a citizen starts with the programming competition, continues with the pole vault as soon as his or her COBOL masterpiece is ready, and then starts gorging on doughnuts as soon as the pole vault is done.

The Supreme Leader of Tutaria closely monitors all citizens and knows the exact amount of time each citizen will take in each of the three tracks. She wants to schedule the event so that it will finish as early as possible. However, the Republic of Tutaria has only one computer, and, as a result, only one person can participate in the COBOL programming event at a time. However, any number of people may simultaneously participate in the pole vault and doughnut-eating competitions.
